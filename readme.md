## Description

Modern data are high-dimensional, for example, images with millions of pixels,
text corpora with millions of words, gene sequences with billions of base pairs,
etc. However, these data tend to concentrate on lower-dimensional, nonlinear
subspaces known as manifolds. This class covers the mathematical theory of
high-dimensional geometry and manifolds and the application of this geometry to
machine learning and data analysis.
